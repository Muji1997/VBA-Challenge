# VBA-Challenge: Stock Metrics Calculator

## Overview

The VBA-Challenge repository is structured to facilitate the analysis of stock data efficiently using VBA scripts. Below are the folders and files included in the repository:

- **VBA_Scripts**: This folder houses individual VBA scripts tailored for each sheet within the Excel workbook. Each script is meticulously crafted to analyze specific data and compute relevant metrics.

- **Screenshots**: This directory contains screenshots showcasing the results obtained after executing the VBA scripts on the sample dataset.

- **alphabetical_testing.xlsx**: This Excel workbook serves as a sample dataset for testing the VBA scripts. It contains a subset of stock data, allowing users to demonstrate the functionality of the scripts and visualize the generated metrics.

## Methodology Applied

To leverage the VBA scripts and analyze stock data effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Excel Workbook**: Begin by opening the `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` file, which holds the stock data for analysis.

2. **Access the VBA Editor**: Use the keyboard shortcut `ALT` + `F11` to access the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) editor embedded within Excel.

3. **Insert Modules**: Within the VBA editor, insert a new module for each sheet in the workbook where analysis is required. This can be done by selecting `Insert` > `Module`.

4. **Copy and Paste VBA Scripts**: Navigate to the `VBA_Scripts` folder and select the appropriate script for the sheet you're working with. Copy the script and paste it into the corresponding module within the VBA editor.

5. **Assign Execution Buttons**: Create buttons (Form Control or ActiveX Control) on each sheet to trigger the execution of the VBA scripts. Assign the relevant script to each button.

6. **Run the Scripts**: Return to the Excel workbook and execute the VBA script for each sheet by clicking the designated button. The scripts will analyze the data and calculate the desired metrics.

7. **Review Results**: Once the scripts have been executed, review the generated metrics and insights presented on each sheet. This analysis will help in making informed decisions regarding the stock data.

By adhering to this structured approach, users can efficiently analyze stock data using VBA scripts, thereby facilitating data-driven decision-making processes.
